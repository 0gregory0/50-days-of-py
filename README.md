***50 Days, 50 Python Exercises***
Here, I attempt the 50 Python exercises from Reuven's book "**Python Workout**: *50 TEN-MINUTE EXERCISES*"

---

## Chapters
This repo has ten folders, representing the ten chapters of the book, each focusing on a different aspect of Python.

The chapters are:

1. **Numeric types**: Integers and floats—and converting between numbers and strings.

2. **Strings**: Working with strings, and seeing them not just as text, but also as
sequences over which you can iterate.
3. **Lists and tuples**: Creating, modifying (in the case of lists), and retrieving from
lists and tuples.

4. **Dictionaries and sets**: Exploring the different ways you can use dicts, and some
of their useful methods. Also, some uses for sets, which are related to dicts.

5. **Files**: Reading from and writing to files.

6. **Functions**: Writing functions, including nested functions. Exploring Python’s
scoping rules.

7. **Functional programming with comprehensions**: Solving problems with list, set,
and dict comprehensions.

8. **Modules and packages**: Writing and using modules in a Python program.

9. **Objects**: Creating classes, writing methods, using attributes, and understanding
inheritance.

10. **Iterators and generators**: Adding the iterator protocol to classes, writing generator functions, and writing generator comprehension
