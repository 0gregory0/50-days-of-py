    "# Exercise 7 -> Ubbi Dubbi\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "Yes. More childish language, because at heart... we are all just big children. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you’ll implement a translator from English into another secret children’s language, [Ubbi Dubbi](http://mng.bz/90zl) (This was popularized on the wonderful American children’s program Zoom, which was on television when I was growing up.) The rules of Ubbi Dubbi are even simpler than those of Pig Latin, although programming a translator is more complex and requires a bit more thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ubbi Dubbi, every vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) is prefaced with ub. Thus milk becomes mubilk (m-ub-ilk) and program becomes prubogrubam (prub-ogrub-am). In theory, you only put an ub before every vowel sound, rather than before each vowel. Given that this is a book about Python and not linguistics, I hope that you’ll forgive this slight difference in definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ubbi Dubbi is enormously fun to speak, and it’s somewhat magical if and when you can begin to understand someone else speaking it. Even if you don’t understand it, Ubbi Dubbi sounds extremely funny. See some YouTube videos on the subject, such as [this](http://mng.bz/aRMY) if you need convincing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Exercise\n",
    "For this exercise, you’ll write a function (called ubbi_dubbi) that takes a single word (string) as an argument. It returns a string, the word’s translation into Ubbi Dubbi. So if the function is called with octopus, the function will return the string uboctubopubus. And if the user passes the argument elephant, you’ll output ubelubephubant.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the original Pig Latin translator, you can ignore capital letters, punctuation, and corner cases, such as multiple vowels combining to create a new sound. When you do have two vowels next to one another, preface each of them with ub. Thus, soap will become suboubap, despite the fact that oa combines to a single vowel sound."
